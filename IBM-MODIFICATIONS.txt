- Description: Main issue is that the window.__XHRShimAliases object gets recreated when window location changes, causing that callbacks for XHR calls 
are never getting received. A condition was added to define if the object is already present, and avoid unnecessary recreation. 
The last one was added to fix an angular use case, to avoid reload on InjectScript Method when the url is changed.
