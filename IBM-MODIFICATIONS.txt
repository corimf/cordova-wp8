- Description: Windows Phone native side wasn't resolving XMLHttpRequest, the URL provided for an XHR call, at times contains some unwanted extra slashes, like: 'x-wmapp0: /www or //www'. Added regular expresion to the js script code to remove any ----> ':/, ://, :///' , any slash after 'x-wmapp0:', in that way the URI class it will be successfully resolved and provide the requested content. Also try-catch statements were added, over the 'Browser.InvokeScript' statements, to avoid: 'A first chance exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' occurred in Microsoft.Phone.Interop.ni.dll', that stops the application.
